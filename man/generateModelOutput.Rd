\title{Generate climate and apply a model.}
\usage{
generateModelOutput(
  modelName,
  fromYr,
  toYr,
  id,
  latDeg,
  longDeg,
  elevM = rep(NA, length(longDeg)),
  isEphemeral = T,
  rep = 1,
  repModel = 1,
  rcp = "RCP45",
  climModel = "RCM4",
  additionalParms = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelName}{a character. Should be one of the models listed in the available models (see the getModelList() method)}

\item{fromYr}{the starting date (yr) of the period (inclusive)}

\item{toYr}{the ending date (yr) of the period (inclusive)}

\item{id}{a vector with the ids of the plots}

\item{latDeg}{the latitudes of the plots}

\item{longDeg}{the longitudes of the plots}

\item{elevM}{the elevations of the plots (can contain some NA or can be NULL, in which cases BioSim relies on a digital elevation model)}

\item{isEphemeral}{a logical. If set to true, the generated climate is not stored on the server, which implies a greater
computational burden and inconsistencies if different models are applied on the same locations. By default, it is set to
true.}

\item{rep}{number of replicates of generated climate (is set to 1 by default)}

\item{repModel}{number of replicates on the model end (is set to 1 by default)}

\item{rcp}{an representative concentration pathway (either "RCP45" or "RCP85")}

\item{climModel}{a climatic model (either "RCM4", "GCM4" or "Hadley")}

\item{additionalParms}{a named vector with the additional parameters if needed}
}
\value{
a data.frame object
}
\description{
This function generated the basic climate variables for some locations
and applies a particular model on this generated climate.

\examples{

locations <- BioSIM::twoLocationsInSouthernQuebec

degreeDays <- generateModelOutput("DegreeDay_Annual", 2017, 2021, locations$Name, locations$Latitude,
                             locations$Longitude, locations$Elevation,
                             rcp = "RCP85", climModel = "GCM4", additionalParms = addParms)}
